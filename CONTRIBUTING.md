# Thank you
**Thank You** for contributing to Data Structures in Javascript. The goal of this repository is to provide scalable data structures for web, mobile, VR and IoT applications.

# What should i know before I get started?
  1. Everything should be tested
  2. we love [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/)

# How can I contribute?
  1. Create an issue about the problem you are solving
  2. If community resolution is modification to the codebase, assign the issue to yourself and create a WIP pull request
    - WIP pull request is great for other contributors to know this particular issue is in development by a community member
    - example: `WIP: Immutable Binary Index Tree `
  3. When your pull request is ready for code review, remove the WIP tag and update the associated issue
    - e.g. `Immutable Binary Index Tree`

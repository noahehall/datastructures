Data structures implemented in the latest javascript, designed for isomorphic and progressive web applications.

current focus is data structures, then i'll swing back to [algorithms](https://github.com/noahehall/algorithms)

Beta release will be useable for all of the awesome applications your building.

# You need this if
  1. Efficiency at scale is a priority for your application and shaving 5ms from your in-app processes is critical for your user experience
  2. Your application requires efficient searching, insertion, and/or retrieval
  3. Your application stores complex data in state
  4. Your application ingest and store large data sets in-app which are frequently accessed and updated (e.g. data visualizations using [D3 v4](https://github.com/noahehall/reactjs-d3-universal))
  5. Immutable data types are important

## Coming soon
  - my plan is to implement the Abstract Data Type for [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) not provided by or not fully implemented by javascript
